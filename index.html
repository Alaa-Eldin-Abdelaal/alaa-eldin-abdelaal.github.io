			1.<b>"Estimating 6-DOF force/torque based on the Force Myography (FMG) signals: A comparative study"</b>:
				 The presented study explored the viability of using the FMG on the arm for 6-axis hand force/torque estimation, and also 
				 examined the effects of the FMG sensors density and location to the force/torque estimation. We performed a comparative study 
				 between four regression algorithms including kernel ridge regression (KRR), general regression neural network (GRNN), Multilayer 
				 Perceptron (MLP) and MLP with AutoEncoders. The results showed that FMG achieves a good performance in multiple-DOF force/torque 
				 estimation, with an average R^2 accuracies of 0.82 across the 6 outputs using four FMG bands on the arm in cross-session evaluation.
        		The findings from this study confirm the viability of using the FMG signals from the arm for multiple axes isometric hand force and 
				torque around the wrist estimation, and knowledge gained from this study provides guidance for hand force/torque estimation in terms
				of optimal FMG sensors location and density.<a href="FMG.pptx">[Poster]</a> </br> </br>

			2.<b>"LOST Highway: a Multiple-Lane Ant-Trail Algorithm to Reduce Congestion in Large-Population Multi-Robot Systems"</b>:
				 In traffic engineering, one way to reduce congestion in roads is to widen them by adding/constructing new lanes. 
				 This eventually leads to highway roads with multiple lanes. In this project, 
				 we propose using the same idea to reduce congestion in multi-robot systems. We consider the resource transportation
				 task where autonomous robots repeatedly transport goods between a food source and a nest. We present a method to
				 establish multiple lanes/trails in order to distribute the robots on the environment, reduce the density of the 
				 trails and increase the system throughput in dense robot populations. In our method, robots lay logical waypoints, called crumbs, 
				 towards their goal locations and broadcast them. These waypoints are virtual pheromones that imitate the way real ants 
				 behave in their environments. Compared with previous works, our results show that our proposed approach increases
				 the system throughput by up to 3.9 times. <a href="LOST Highway - a Multiple-Lane Ant-Trail Algorithm to Reduce Congestion in Large-Population Multi-Robot Systems.pdf">[pdf]</a> </br> </br>

			3.<b>"Intrinsic Images using Entropy Minimization: Discussion and Implementation"</b>:
				 Obtaining intrinsic images that are illumination invariant
					can be important to solve the problem of removing shadows from images. In this work, we present a method for
					obtaining these intrinsic images based only on evidence of
					the color image itself. This method is called entropy minimization. We show how this method can be used to obtain both the greyscale and L1 chromaticity versions of the
					shadow-free image. Moreover, we present a way to identify the shadow edges as a first step towards reaching the
					full color shadow-free image. Results of our implementation for this method show the effectiveness of this proposed
					approach when applied to unsourced imagery. <a href="Intrinsic Images using Entropy Minimization Discussion and Implementation.pdf">[pdf]</a> </br></br>

			Recent work <a href="https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/papers/ibrahim-cvpr16.bib">by Ibrahim et al</a> for tackling the group activity
			recognition problem is based on Hierarchical Deep Temporal Model. The model
			recognizes the individual people dynamics and based on its aggregation
			recognizes the whole scene activity. In our work, we extend their work in
			several directions to enhance overall performance. We come up with a
			spatio-temporal graph representation to fix walking, crossing and waiting
			categories confusion problems. In addition, we explore a new generic feature
			representation based on Bag of Visual Words (BOVW). 
			Our approaches provide state-of-the-art results over 2 datasets: the Collective
			activity dataset and the volleyball dataset.

			<b>"One-eyed Self-learning Robotic Arm"</b>: The project's idea is based on designing a self-learning robotic arm that is 
			equipped with a vision system. The project aims at using automatic control with computer vision to produce smart robotic arms that 
			can be used in many industrial applications like painting. The work starts when a picture of 
			the object to be painted is captured. Then, our computer vision algorithm recognizes this object and compares it with the 
			stored objects in a database which contains previously painted objects. If a match is found, then the arm repeats the corresponding movements for the 
			painting process. If not, the algorithm obtains some points that constitutes
			a suitable path for painting the object.
			Using inverse kinematics, these points are then converted into angles for
			the motors of the arm robot.
